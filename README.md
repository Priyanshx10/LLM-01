🧠 LLM Projects and Learning Hub
This repository contains a collection of Language Model (LLM) projects and educational resources, built from scratch in PyTorch and Python. The goal is to provide hands-on, minimalist implementations of language modeling techniques—from character-level to word-level and beyond—along with clear explanations and reproducible code.

📚 What’s Inside
Project 01 – Character-Level Tiny LLM
A minimal character-by-character text generator.
Learn character-level tokenization, simple LSTM usage, and basics of sequence modeling.

Project 02 – Word-Level Tiny LLM
A tiny LLM that predicts words rather than characters.
Covers custom tokenization, word vocab construction, and word-level sequence modeling.

Future Projects
Plans for more advanced architectures (GRU, Transformer, dataset scaling, utility scripts, etc).

🎓 Purpose
Understand the foundations of LLMs without heavy abstractions.
Gain proficiency with PyTorch, tokenization, embeddings, RNNs, and model training from scratch.
Learn best practices for data preparation, reproducibility, and model evaluation.
Encourage experimentation, modification, and extension for learners at all skill levels.
